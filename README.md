# Semantic_Meaningfulness_CF

This Repository implements a metric to measure semantic meaningfulness by comparing counterfactual outcomes with the outcomes of a causal graph. 
The implementation is based on <a href='https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA'>CARLA</a> and further offers additional causal models.
